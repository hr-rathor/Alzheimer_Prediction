# Alzheimer Prediction
This project aims to predict Alzheimer’s Disease progression using machine learning. The goal is to classify individuals into different disease stages based on medical and cognitive data.

# Overview
Alzheimer’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder. Early detection can improve management. This project applies various ML algorithms to predict Alzheimer’s stages based on patient data.

# Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Data**: MRI results, cognitive test scores, demographics, genetic factors (APOE4), and diagnosis.
- Place dataset in the data/ directory.

# Modeling Process
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, scaling, encoding.
- **Modeling**: Train models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, etc.)
- **Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, F1-score.
# Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest (Accuracy: XX%)
- **Key Features**: MRI data, cognitive tests, age.
