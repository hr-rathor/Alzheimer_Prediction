Project Overview
Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory and cognitive function. Early prediction and diagnosis are crucial for managing the disease. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to predict Alzheimer’s stages based on features such as MRI scans, cognitive tests, and demographic information.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and training of multiple machine learning models to determine the most accurate predictor of the disease.

Dataset
Source: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of clinical and MRI data of patients at different stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
Features:
MRI scan data
Age, Gender
Cognitive test scores
Genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE4)
Diagnosis status (Normal, MCI, Dementia)
Ensure to download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
